# Reddit Data Pipeline â€” Batch ETL with Airflow

## Overview
This project builds a batch ETL pipeline that extracts Reddit posts from a selected subreddit, processes the data through Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, and automates the workflow using Apache Airflow.  
The pipeline simulates a cloud data engineering setup locally using Python, Airflow, and local file storage.


## Tech Stack
- Python
- Apache Airflow (Local Setup)
- Pandas
- Reddit API (praw)
- SQLite (optional for queries)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
